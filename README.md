# NoCRouter

**An RTL Router Design in SystemVerilog**

The on-chip router represents the key component in the NoC.  
The project requires to design and implement a simple NoC router that supports Virtual Channels.  
The four stage architecture is the baseline solution while the VA-SA Speculative implementation represents a critical add-on for the project.  
The final design requires a complete TestBench for regressions.
